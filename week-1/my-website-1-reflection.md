Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

On a really simple level GitHub can be used to store content like Dropbox does. My repository on the site is where I can keep and manage my files. Anyone with an account can push a button to create one and name it, then your personal repository is given its own web address. If I want to 'clone' the repository, it's similar to downloading a folder that has files in it. Instead of downloading straight from a folder icon on the site I just copy the link given to you for cloning. Then I run one command on my Terminal pasting in that web link. Now I've got those files on my computer and I'm free to edit them.

Describe what open source means.

The source code for the software or project is free and available to everyone to download, make edits or distribute. This means businesses can't control content or distribution, but everyone else is free to contribute to it as they see fit.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I think it's great! A software company has a vision for its products and devotes all its resources to packaging and marketing software according to this vision. Open source projects are virtually unlimited in scope because an enthusiastic community can add features or improve functionality at an incredible rate - while being unbound by one entity's principles of marketability.

Assess the importance of using licenses.

Seems like a really good idea! Even if I firmly believe my work should be free and open and even if I knew I never stood to make a dollar on any of it, I'd still like to know that there was a mechanism to prove that I did the work in the first place.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

The more I go through the whole clone-checkout-branch-edit-add-commit-push-pull thing the more comfortable I feel, so that was good. The way licensing works was a revelation, I wondered that about open source projects. I hesitated a lot when trying to decide where to put my website clone repo on my computer. I wondered if I should make a GitHub folder or just put it in my root directory etc. basically just trying to weigh if I was going to be accessing it all the time/ how simple I wanted the file to be in the command line and everything. I think I spend waay too much time on that kind of thing.

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Actually I didn't do any research outside the scope of the canvas outline for this exercise, beside the articles that were linked.
