###Design and Site-Planning

Web design is sometimes thought of as the finishing touches to a web-based project, but in practice, good web design should inform the entire process of development from the beginning.

The 6 phases of web design as defined in the reading are:

1. Information Gathering

2. Planning

3. Design

4. Development

5. Testing and Delivery

6. Maintenance

My personal site will be designed to establish a professional focus for my development career - to provide information about me to clients and potential employers as well as contact and social media info for collaboration with other professionals. Besides basic info and contacts, my site will host projects I've done to serve as an online portfolio. This content will address all 3 groups of anticipated viewers, or my audience (clients, employers, other developers). Here is my first quick sketch of a site map:

As primary actions users can take from the home page, contact and portfolio will have priority. All pages branching from the index will be linked in a navigation bar, but these 2 will be specially highlighted with either a prominent link or call-to-action buttons.

User experience development comes from the idea that web pages and applications should be built with users in mind. Just like advertisers market to a target audience, web developers should seek to orient the look and structure of a web experience to best suit the user. This is not just style and aesthetics, although those are important, but also the flow of a page and overall site structure. Some developers are UX experts specifically, but in general it's a concept that should elevate the best practices of all web professionals.

The only frustrations I felt in this assignment were during the sketch for my site map. I wouldn't call it 'tedious', I just froze at first when trying to conceptualize my professional site, but then realized I was overthinking it at this stage.
