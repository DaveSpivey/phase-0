For this challenge I worked with Zander to re-create Berkshire Hathaway's visually stunning site. It was pretty straightforward so I didn't expect to run into any problems, but I did learn &reg; and &copy; so those are pretty neat. Just doing the same code over and over always helps too, i.e. <a href=""> <li> etc.

Refraining from formatting was actually no problem here, seeing as how the site was so minimal to start with. It probably would've been more of a challenge if we were given a screenshot of the actual live site with CSS added, but that could have muddied the intent of the challenge.

HTML is good at organizing content. It sets up the structure of a page and it gives the browser what information you want and where to find it, in what order. What's it's not good for is telling a browser how you want it to look. While styling is possible within html scripts, it's good practice to keep all those elements in related CSS files for easier and clearer editing.

The trick that helps most while writing HTML is to go ahead and put a closing tab in before writing that element's content. I think I would forget 50% of the time if I didn't do this.
