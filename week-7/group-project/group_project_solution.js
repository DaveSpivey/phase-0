// Pseudocode by Dave Spivey

// Create a function named 'sum' that takes an array of numbers as an argument
// Iterate through the elements and add them all together, returning the result

// Create a function named 'mean' that takes an array of numbers as an argument
// Iterate through elements and calculate the average value, returning the average

// Create a function named 'median' that takes an array of numbers as an argument
// Sort the array numerically
// If the number of elements is odd, return the value of the number in the center of the sorted array
// If the number of elements is even, return the value produced by averaging the center two elements
