  So I felt a little more confident with CSS positioning this time than last week, but this specific challenge stumped me on column-count. It seemed really counterintuitive to lock the whole section up in one element and then try to style the text.
   We wanted to have the git commands be in one section and the explanations be a different element - that way styling would be easy. The instructions said to only use CSS, but we were unclear how untouched HTML should be, so we decided to go with the column-count thing.
  Didn't really end up matching the definitions up visually, but at least we got the overflow working so they are ordered correctly.
